  title: Cornmeal Lime Shortbread Fans Recipe
  description: >-
    Buttery and crisp, with an appealing texture from the cornmeal, these
    shortbread cookies are baked in a round tart or pie tin, then cut into
    wedges to resemble slim fans The lime juice in the glaze cuts the sweetness
    and echoes the zest in the dough (You can also use lemon, orange or
    grapefruit — or a combination instead of lime, if you prefer.) The cookies
    keep for up to two weeks when stored airtight at room temperature, and
    freeze very well.

  title: Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe
  description: >-
    Almond flour is the only special ingredient needed to make these cookies,
    and it can be found in the baking aisle or the health food section of the
    grocery store It provides the protein and structure of a classic wheat
    flour, while keeping the cookie perfectly chewy in the center If you want a
    stronger almond flavor, toast the almond flour in a dry skillet over
    medium-low heat until golden and fragrant, and cool before using

  title: Seafood Chowder Recipe
  description: "This chowder of root-cellar vegetables, clams and fish is one of the easiest and best things to cook for a weekend dinner with family and friends Use a mixture of butter and the powdered dried seaweed called dulse as the flavored fat in which you sauté the vegetables before deglazing them, and each individual flavor in the resulting stew will pop — from carrot to leek, parsnip to potato, bacon to clam to scallop to fish.\_The seaweed is a powerful flavor enhancer You can omit it if you want, but really, you shouldn't."
