  title: Cornmeal Lime Shortbread Fans Recipe
  description: >-
    Buttery and crisp, with an appealing texture from the cornmeal, these
    shortbread cookies are baked in a round tart or pie tin, then cut into
    wedges to resemble slim fans The lime juice in the glaze cuts the sweetness
    and echoes the zest in the dough (You can also use lemon, orange or
    grapefruit — or a combination instead of lime, if you prefer.) The cookies
    keep for up to two weeks when stored airtight at room temperature, and
    freeze very well.

  title: Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe
  description: >-
    Almond flour is the only special ingredient needed to make these cookies,
    and it can be found in the baking aisle or the health food section of the
    grocery store It provides the protein and structure of a classic wheat
    flour, while keeping the cookie perfectly chewy in the center If you want a
    stronger almond flavor, toast the almond flour in a dry skillet over
    medium-low heat until golden and fragrant, and cool before using

  title: Black Pepper Beef and Cabbage Stir-Fry Recipe
  description: >-
    Coarsely crushed black peppercorns star in this quick weeknight dish, which
    is built primarily from pantry staples Don’t be shy about adding the entire
    tablespoon of pepper, as it balances out the richness of the beef and adds a
    lightly spicy bite to the dish A quick rub of garlic, brown sugar, salt,
    pepper and cornstarch seasons the beef; the cornstarch helps tenderize the
    beef and later imparts a silky texture to the sauce
